Add Portfolio project to repository

This is my second project at Udacity, Nanodegree Full Stack Web Developer program, it contains logo, name of the author, main image and some portfolio with titles and links.

The cc folder contains main style with colors, fonts and responsive, the other one is bootstrap framework.

The index.html is the main page

Here are included these files:
